# dataset-danish-digital-tabloids

As a part of my master thesis in Business Administration and e-Business at Copenhagen Business School, a dataset consisting of articles from Danish Digital Tabloids was created by scraping them using python. The dataset can be used for NLP projects. It mostly consists of articles about celebrities, however, 4276 articles in total are not concerning people.

The websites that were scraped were the following:
Billedbladet: "https://www.billedbladet.dk/kendte" (23219 articles). Time period: 08/03/2013-24/08/2021.
BT: "https://www.bt.dk/underholdning" (308 articles). Time period: 07/08/2021-24/08/2021.
HerogNu: "https://herognu.dk/kendte" (4160 articles). Time period: 08/12/2014-17/08/2021.

I labeled all of the articles according to whether they were concerning a man, woman, couple, or not concerning people. Furthermore, I can share the code for scraping if you are interested in more recent articles. I can be contacted at: leonora.dyre@outlook.dk for requests, questions or additional information about my research.
